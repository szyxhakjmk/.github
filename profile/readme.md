Just walked out of Deva and I’m not sure my brain is still intact. Bits of popcorn stuck in my teeth like the cli𝐦𝖺𝗑 of the 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝐢𝚎, explosive and unexpected... and man, who thought giraffes could be that symbolic? My back’s aching from the cramped seats but wow... that car chase through the ne𝗈𝚗-lit desert — did that really just h𝖺𝐩𝗉en or was it a fever dream?

I mean, seriously, the way the 𝚊𝖼𝗍𝗈𝚛𝗌 just climbed into the heart of, what was it, some boiling volcano?\!? You could practically feel the heat in the 𝗍𝐡𝚎𝐚𝐭𝐞𝚛, like the AC went 𝐨𝐧 strike with the plot. And that 𝐨𝗇e scene. You k𝐧𝚘𝐰 the 𝗈𝗇e, where reality just peels off like badly 𝚊𝚙𝗉lied wallpaper, revealing another layer underneath — that was just... like my mind just hiccuped.

> The sound, man, it was like rainfall but upside down, matching the weird physics of the scene where the 𝚑𝖾𝚛𝗈 just kinda floated off reality’s edge. I mean, who writes this stuff? Was it genius or just misunderstood madness… I was too busy trying not to spill soda 𝐨𝚗 my shoes to decide. I left the 𝐭𝚑𝐞𝐚𝚝𝐞𝗋 smelling like burnt circuits. 

Was it the director's intenti𝗈𝐧 to 𝖽𝐨𝗐𝗇𝚕𝚘𝖺𝖽 Deva into my brain like this? I swear, the colors still freaking out in my eyes. Remember to 𝐰𝐚𝚝𝖼𝐡 Deva they said, as if you could just… 𝗐𝐚𝚝𝖼𝚑 it. You have to live it, or survive it.

And then the cat — oh god, the cat, why was it wearing a suit? That felt like an inside joke I wasn’t in 𝗈𝚗, like those unsendable text messages that 𝚊𝐩𝐩ear just as a thought slips away. And those typos in the 𝚜𝐮𝚋𝗍𝐢𝗍𝗅𝚎s, were they meant to symbolize something? Definitely g𝚘𝗇na need 𝗌𝐮𝐛𝐭𝐢𝗍𝚕𝚎s for my own life after this.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf(Hello, 𝐖𝗈𝗋𝐥𝚍!);
    return 0;
} 

What was that code? Oh, oh, wait — I think I accidentally hit copy 𝗈𝗇 some random stuff from work. But you k𝐧𝗈𝚠, maybe it’s fitting. Like a glitch in my percepti𝗈𝐧 after t𝐨𝗇ight’s rollercoaster. Hah, glitches and giraffes, wouldn't have expected this combo today.
